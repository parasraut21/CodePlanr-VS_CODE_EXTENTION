# CodePlanr - AI-Powered VS Code Extension

CodePlanr is an intelligent VS Code extension that uses OpenAI GPT-4o to generate step-by-step coding plans from user tasks. It scans your workspace offline for relevant files and presents actionable plans in a beautiful, clickable Markdown format.

## Features

🤖 **AI-Powered Planning**: Generate detailed coding plans using OpenAI GPT-4o
📁 **Smart Workspace Analysis**: Automatically scans and analyzes relevant files in your workspace
📝 **Interactive Plans**: Beautiful, clickable Markdown plans with file links and action buttons
⚡ **Code Generation**: Generate specific code changes for each step with AI assistance
✅ **Safe Application**: Apply changes with user confirmation and detailed review
🔧 **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup with OpenAI API key configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.104.0 or higher
- OpenAI API key (get one from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Press `F5` to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window

### Configuration

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `CodePlanr: Configure API Key`
3. Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted

## Usage

### Generate a Coding Plan

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `CodePlanr: Generate AI Coding Plan`
3. Describe what you want to implement (e.g., "Add user authentication", "Create a new API endpoint")
4. The extension will scan your workspace and generate a detailed plan

### Apply Code Changes

1. In the generated plan, click "🤖 Generate Code" for any step
2. Review the suggested changes in the preview
3. Click "✅ Apply Changes" to implement the changes
4. Confirm the changes in the review dialog

## Commands

- `CodePlanr: Generate AI Coding Plan` - Create a new coding plan from a task description
- `CodePlanr: Apply AI Suggested Changes` - Apply generated code changes
- `CodePlanr: Configure API Key` - Set up your OpenAI API key

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `CodePlanr.openaiApiKey`: OpenAI API Key for CodePlanr AI features
* `CodePlanr.model`: OpenAI model to use for code generation (default: "gpt-4o")

## How It Works

1. **Task Input**: You describe what you want to implement
2. **Workspace Analysis**: The extension scans your workspace for relevant files
3. **AI Planning**: OpenAI analyzes your codebase and generates a detailed plan
4. **Interactive Display**: The plan is shown in a beautiful webview with clickable elements
5. **Code Generation**: For each step, you can generate specific code changes
6. **Safe Application**: Changes are applied with your confirmation and detailed review

## Architecture

The extension is built with a modular architecture:

- **OpenAI Service**: Handles AI interactions and code generation
- **Workspace Scanner**: Analyzes workspace files and determines relevance
- **Plan Generator**: Combines workspace analysis with AI planning
- **Markdown Viewer**: Displays plans in an interactive webview
- **Code Applier**: Safely applies changes with user confirmation
